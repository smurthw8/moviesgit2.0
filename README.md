## Known Issues / Future Improvements
There are many, but here are acouple:
     
Github Actions:
- Create a .github/workflows folder. Inside it create a ci.yml (continuous integration) and a cd.yml (continous integration) file. 
- Add a github secret for the aws access key and secret. Include those in as varibles in the matrix. 
- Include eslint, terraform fmt, npm audit, and other code checks. 
- Do all the fun stuff
     
Terraform: 
- Develop and follow a naming convention for resources
- Go through and update tagging to include name, and other tags. 
- Change Database to instead create a random username and password that are encrypted and stored in the parameter store.
- Audit and change security groups, and vpc to follow the principle of least privlege
     
 App:
- Create a v1.yml open api document to use for the api. Enforce it with API enforcer. [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
- Query aws to retrieve the parameters needed for the database username, and password from the parameter store. Retrieve the host through env variables.
